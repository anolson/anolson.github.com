title:  Hello 37signals

<p>I want to be your next Rails programmer.</p>

<h3>A little bit about me.</h3>

<p>Hello, I'm Andrew Olson.  I develop software.  I like to build web applications more than anything else.  The web is simple to use.  It is available everywhere, and applications are always up to date.  Customers can get started with your application in seconds.  There is nothing to install.</p>

<p>I started using Ruby on Rails several years ago.  Rails is the most enjoyable web framework that I have used.  Rails makes it easy to to write beautiful and elegant code.  The deployment of Rails applications is a delight.  The rich environment that Ruby provides means that there are plenty of tools to choose from.</p>

<h3>Why do I want to work at 37signals?</h3>

<p>You're the right size.  You have grown at a reasonable rate. You're not going to sell out and you're going to be around for a long time.  I would love to still be working there in 20 or more years.</p>

<p>Above all I want to develop for the web.  You create some of the best software out there.</p>

<h3>Rails projects.</h3>

<p>These are some of the Rails projects that I've worked on.</p>
